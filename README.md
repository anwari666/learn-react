This is a pet project to jumpstart my learning about React & Redux, written in ES6 using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In future exercise, it will be replaced by Webpack and should cover asset bundling (js, css, html, other static assets), SASS/SCSS compilation, unit testing, and minification.

## Content
The content is divided into exercises. Currently there are 5 exercises:
1. SimpleForm. To show React's one-way data binding (as opposed to Angular's two-way data binding.)
2. Filterable Product. Filters are enabled by its name and its category using React's state.
3. Tic Tac Toe game, using only React. 
4. Todo app, using Redux and React. This is allows a great intro to Redux's app structure. Also, it ties the root Redux's store into React.
5. Stocky (work in progress). A retrospective stock investment simulator that takes investment value, date of investment and stock price as an input. It will automatically projects the value of the portfolio in current prices. Using the free IEX stock API, Chartjs, Redux, and React.
